        <p  style="font: size 14px;">Alex Pattarini is a graduate student at Georgetown University studying for an MS in Data Science and Analytics with an expected graduation date of May 2024. 
            He is also currently an undergraduate student at Georgetown University studying government with a minor in statistics and will graduate in May 2023. Mr. Pattarini is also
            a research assistant at Free Our Vote at the Massive Data Institute (MDI) at the McCourt School of Public Policy at Georgetown University. His work is mainly writing web scrapers
            that scrape state county court records for convicted felons. These records are then processed to ascertain the debts felons owe to their respective states, 
            which must be paid off for them to regain their right to vote. His work at the MDI also includes text mining Supreme Court case briefs and analyzing differences in language use and
            referencing to other cases over time.</p>
