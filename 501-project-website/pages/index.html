        Alex Pattarini is a graduate student at Georgetown University studying for an MS in Data Science and Analytics with an expected graduation date of May 2024. 
            He is also currently an undergraduate student at Georgetown University studying government with a minor in statistics and will graduate in May 2023. In his major of government, he has 
            primarily studied issues in political economy and of human development, with special attention towards the characteristics and effects of institutions upon the well-being of governments
            and their citizens. In his minor of statistics at GU, he has developed extensive skills in data visualization, basic and advanced regression methods, data processing, and data cleaning using 
            R and Python, producing numerous data analysis projects. His projects have focused primarily upon indicators of human development as well as public transportation access and effectiveness.
            As a graduate student in the Data Science and Analytics program at Georgetown University, Alex plans to further expand upon his data analysis skills, specifically machine learning techniques,
            GIS, SQL, and the use of big data, among other pertinent data science skills.

            Mr. Pattarini is also an MDI Scholar and
            research assistant at the non-profit <a href="https://freeourvote.com/" target="_blank">Free Our Vote</a> at the <a href="https://mdi.georgetown.edu/" target="_blank">Massive Data Institute</a> (MDI) at the McCourt School of Public Policy at Georgetown University. His work is mainly writing web scrapers
            that scrape state county court records for convicted felons. These records are then processed to ascertain the debts felons owe to their respective states, 
            which must be paid off for them to regain their right to vote. Specifically, his work has focused upon various counties in Georgia and Florida, such as Fulton, Clayton, and Cobb County. 
            This will eventually result in the creation/addition to a platform that will enable felons to ascertain what fines (if any) they ower to their respective states governments, and thus see if they are able to vote.
            His work at the MDI also includes text mining Supreme Court case briefs and analyzing differences in language use as well as references to other cases over time. Additionally, he is part of a 
            project that will engage in textual analysis of U.S. executive department documents to ascertain trends and commonly used language, and then cross-compare to other government agencies.
