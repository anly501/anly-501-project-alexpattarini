                        <p>Public transportation is the lifeline of tens of millions of Americans every day. Whether it is commuting to work, traveling to school, or simply visiting friends and family, public
                            transportation remains an incredibly important resource nationwide. Nowhere is this more apparent than in major cities throughout the United States, where many individuals are especially
                            reliant on public transit to facilitate their lives, specifically through heavy rail based transportation networks. Heavy rail encompasses a wide range of train transport types, such as
                            cargo transport, national passenger rail (i.e., Amtrak), local commuter rail networks, and more. This project will focus, in particular, on local heavy rail subway systems, or subway/metro 
                            systems such as the New York City Subway System, Washington DC's Metrorail network, the Bay Area's BART system, and more. These systems transport hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people
                            each day, and are oftentimes as essential to the functioning of such cities as their roads and sidewalks.
