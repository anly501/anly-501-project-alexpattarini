                        <p>Public transportation is the lifeline of tens of millions of Americans every day. Whether it is commuting to work, traveling to school, or simply visiting friends and family, public
                            transportation remains an incredibly important resource nationwide. Nowhere is this more apparent than in major cities throughout the United States, where many individuals are especially
                            reliant on public transit to facilitate their lives, specifically through heavy rail based transportation networks. Heavy rail encompasses a wide range of train transport types, such as
                            cargo transport, national passenger rail (i.e., Amtrak), local commuter rail networks, and more. This project will focus primarily on the effectiveness of passenger rail systems. 
                            These systems transport hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people each day, and are oftentimes as essential to the functioning of such cities as their roads and sidewalks.
                            Thus, it is essential that their effectiveness/lack thereof be analyzed to diagnose what problems there may be, and how those problems may be addressed.

                            The primary focus of my analyses will regarding the heavy rail systems of the transit agencies around the New York City Metropolitan Area. This include the New York City Subway,
                            the Long Island Railroad (LIRR), and Metro-North (all pictured left and above). All three of these agnecies transport millions of students, workers, families, and more daily, 
                            and thus hold a tremendous amount of influence on the functioning of the local, national, and international economy as well as the well-being of countless individuals. It is only
                            natural that these agencies be subject to intense and thorough scrutiny and analysis. Through this project, I aim to assess the overall effectiveness/efficiency of these three agencies, compare
                            them against each other, as well as anaylzing public sentiments regarding these agencies. More specifically, this project will aim to address a set of several questions listed below, and more.

            <h2>What Methods will be Applied?</h2>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        <p>
                            There will be a wide variety of machine learning methods applied to these data. The technical explanations for the mechanisms behind these methods are 
                            explained in more depth within their respective sections, however they are each introduced briefly here. The first methods that will be applied are supervised, classification 
                            machine learning methods that aim to classify labelled data into different categories.
                            The first of these is based upon Bayes' Theorem, known as Naive Bayes, and is explained in more depth in its respective section. Both tweets and service reliability metrics will have Naive Bayes 
                            applied to them. Decision trees also aim to classify, but instead based on an "if-else" type of structure, and I will apply decision trees to service reliability data. Support 
                            Vector Machines can separate a group of data in a binary manner (i.e., two categories) using distance metrics, and I will apply this to tweets regarding public opinion of 
                            the MTA.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Subsequently, I will move to unsupervised machine learning methods, namely clustering and association rule mining (ARM). These methods aim to find underlying patterns in 
                            unlabeled data sets. Clustering encompasses a wide variety of methods that aim to find groups within data sets that do not contain known groupings. There are many different 
                            ways data can be clustered, and three of those methods will be explored in the clustering section of this project, where weather data will be compared to service reliability 
                            metrics. Finally, ARM will be applied to data gleaned from tweets relating to delays on the NYC Subway. ARM uses transactional data and aims to find commonalities between different 
                            observations while quantifying the strength of their relationships, aiming to find previously hidden relationships between different variables.

        <h2>The Big Questions</h2>
        <div class="section-body">
            <!--list of questions, ul was not used due to style sheet issues-->
            <p>1. How "on-time" are each of transit agencies' rail services?</p>
            <p>2. How reliable is the service for these rail agencies?</p>
            <p>3. Do the natural elements have any effect on rail service?</p>
            <p>4. What factors are most important/impactful towards rail service?</p>
            <p>5. Do these factors vary across transit agency (MNR, LIRR, Subways)?</p>
            <p>6. Which transit agency is the most "reliable"?</p>
            <p>7. How does the public regard these transit agencies?</p>
            <p>8. Has the relationship between the public and transit agencies changed over time?</p>
            <p>9. How do train delays spread across the NYC subway system?</p>
            <p>10. What relationships exist (if any) between the different lines of the NYC subway system?</p>
        </div>
        <p class="section-body">
            These questions will all be addressed in the subsequent analysis, and conclusions will be drawn regarding a holistic impression of the NYC rail transit system as a whole. These conclusions
            will concern both in-group analyses and cross comparisons between these three agencies, encompassing a wide variety of indicators from performance metrics indicating on time percentage and
            mean distance between failures to public opinion data gathered from twitter to weather data gathered from the NOAA, and much more.
