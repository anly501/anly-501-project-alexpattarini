                        <p>Public transportation is the lifeline of tens of millions of Americans every day. Whether it is commuting to work, traveling to school, or simply visiting friends and family, public
                            transportation remains an incredibly important resource nationwide. Nowhere is this more apparent than in major cities throughout the United States, where many individuals are especially
                            reliant on public transit to facilitate their lives, specifically through heavy rail based transportation networks. Heavy rail encompasses a wide range of train transport types, such as
                            cargo transport, national passenger rail (i.e., Amtrak), local commuter rail networks, and more. This project will focus primarily on the effectiveness of passenger rail systems. 
                            These systems transport hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people each day, and are oftentimes as essential to the functioning of such cities as their roads and sidewalks.
                            Thus, it is essential that their effectiveness/lack thereof be analyzed to diagnose what problems there may be, and how those problems may be addressed.

                            The primary focus of my analyses will regarding the heavy rail systems of the transit agencies around the New York City Metropolitan Area. This include the New York City Subway,
                            the Long Island Railroad (LIRR), and Metro-North (all pictured left and above). All three of these agnecies transport millions of students, workers, families, and more daily, 
                            and thus hold a tremendous amount of influence on the functioning of the local, national, and international economy as well as the well-being of countless individuals. It is only
                            natural that these agencies be subject to intense and thorough scrutiny and analysis. Through this project, I aim to assess the overall effectiveness/efficiency of these three agencies, compare
                            them against each other, as well as anaylzing public sentiments regarding these agencies. More specifically, this project will aim to address a set of several questions listed below, and more.

        <h2>The Big Questions</h2>
        <div class="section-body">
            <!--list of questions, ul was not used due to style sheet issues-->
            <p>1. How "on-time" are each of transit agencies' rail services?</p>
            <p>2. How frequently do service interruptions occur across agencies?</p>
            <p>3. What is the nature of these service interruptions and do they vary across agencies?</p>
            <p>4. How has the COVID-19 pandemic influenced these phenomena?</p>
            <p>5. Where (geographically) are these effects most damaging/influential?</p>
            <p>6. How does the public regard these transit agencies?</p>
            <p>7. Has the relationship between the public and transit agencies changed over time?</p>
            <p>8. How has the effectiveness of transportation affected local economic activity?</p>
            <p>9. Have the steps taken by these agencies to address their issues/shortcomings been effective?</p>
            <p>10. How efficient and "on-time" have transit agency construction projects been?</p>
        </div>
        <p class="section-body">
            These questions will all be addressed in the subsequent analysis, and conclusions will be drawn regarding a holistic impression of the NYC rail transit system as a whole. These conclusions
            will concern both in-group analyses and cross comparisons between these three agencies, encompassing a wide variety of indicators from the physical transit capabilities of these agencies to
            public opinion to overall accessibility and safety with regard to the neighborhoods and towns this massive transit system is situated within.
