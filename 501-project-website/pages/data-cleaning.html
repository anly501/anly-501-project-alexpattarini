            In order to have useful data for a proper analysis of the heavy rail transport of NYC, the data gathered in the previous tab must be cleaned. This entails reshaping and modifying the format of the data
            to be in a more appropriate manner for exploratory data analysis and deeper machine learning analyses. The raw data that was cleaned can be found in both the <a href="../pages/data-gathering.html">Data Gathering</a>
            tab as well as in this project's <a href="https://github.com/anly501/anly-501-project-alexpattarini/tree/main/data/00-raw-data">Github repository folder</a>. Modified data files will be available
            for download in their respective section below when applicable. All code scripts that were used to clean the accompanying data sets and produce the modified data sets can be found in a Github repository folder
            <a href="">here</a>.

                        From a cursory look at the data gathered in the data gathering section of this project, it is apparent that the on-time performance data and delay data for the LIRR and MNR share two common column names and values within:
                        Service Date and Agency. Additionally, these two data sets share similar topic, and thus it is appropriate that they may be combined. The cleaning and combination of these data sets was 
                        accomplished using an R script that can be downloaded here
