                Before conducting a more thorough and deep analysis of the efficiency and opinions of the NYC heavy rail agencies, exploratory data analysis (EDA) must be performed. EDA consists of 
                creating visualizations and analyzing statistical characteristics of the data sets cleaned in the <a href="../pages/data-cleaning.html">Data Gathering</a> section to see what trends are important/potentially present, what variables
                should be considered in models, and much more. Below is a series of graphs with accompanying descriptions that apply EDA to this project. Modified data sets that were used as the basis 
                for these graphs can be found in the aforementioned Data Cleaning section, however the scripts that generate these visualizations and statistical summaries can be downloaded and viewed both in their 
                individual sections and in <a href="">this</a> Github repository folder.
